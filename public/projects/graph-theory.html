			<div class="break"></div>

			<p class="text">
				Graph theory is a field of <b>discrete mathematics</b> that deals with the ideas of <b>graphs</b>. In their simplest form, graphs are networks of
				<b>nodes</b> (also known as vertices) connected by <b>edges</b>. Anything that can be drawn as dots connected by lines can also be represented by a graph.
				Examples of this include road networks, friend groups, electrical circuits, subway systems, and molecular structures.

			<h5 class="title">CONNECTED BY EDGES...</h5>
			<p class="text">
				Two nodes can be connected by more than one edge, each called a <b>multiple edge</b>. This can represent, say, a multi-lane road or a molecule's double bond.
				Nodes can also be connected to themselves with a special type of edge called a <b>loop</b>. The ends of the subway lines in
				<span class="highlighted">fig. 1.3</span> could be considered loops, as trains turn around when they reach them.<br /><br />Edges can have a set direction. They
				can be one-way, like a one-way street or a link from one website to another, or two-way. Edges with a specified direction are called <b>directed edges</b>.

				Graphs without loops or multiple edges (like <span class="highlighted">fig. 1.7</span>) are called <b>simple graphs</b>. Graphs that consist of directed edges
				are called <b>directed graphs</b>. Both <span class="highlighted">fig. 1.6</span> and <span class="highlighted">fig. 1.7</span> are directed graphs. A route
				from one node to another is called a <b>walk</b>. A walk without repeated edges is called a <b>trail</b>, and a walk without repeated nodes is called a
				<b>path</b>. A walk that ends at the same node where it began is called a <b>cycle</b>. Any loop or pair of multiple edges is a cycle. Trails and paths that are
				also cycles are considered <b>closed</b>.

				If a graph contains a closed trail that travels across every edge, that graph is <b>Eulerian</b>. And if a graph contains a closed path that visits every node,

				If you've ever programmed or learned about probability, you've probably come across an example of a <b>tree</b>. Trees are a restricted type of graph in which
				all nodes stem from one, meaning there is only one path between any two nodes. All trees are graphs, but not all graphs are trees.
