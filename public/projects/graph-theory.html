			<div class="break"></div>

			<p class="text">
				Graph theory is a field of <b>discrete mathematics</b> that deals with the ideas of <b>graphs</b>. In their simplest form, graphs are networks of
				<b>nodes</b> (also known as vertices) connected by <b>edges</b>. Anything that can be drawn as dots connected by lines can also be represented by a graph.
				Examples of this include road networks, friend groups, electrical circuits, subway systems, and molecular structures.

				Two nodes can be connected by more than one edge, each called a <b>multiple edge</b>. This can represent, say, a multi-lane road or a molecule’s double bond.
				Nodes can also be connected to themselves with a special type of edge called a <b>loop</b>. The ends of the subway lines in
				<span class="highlighted">fig. 1.3</span> could be considered loops, as trains turn around when they reach them.<br /><br />Edges can have a set direction. They
				can be one-way, like a one-way street or a link from one website to another, or two-way. Edges with a specified direction are called <b>directed edges</b>.

			<div class="break"></div>

			<p class="text">
				In 1736, Leonhard Euler wrote the first paper on what is now considered graph theory to prove that the Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem has no solution.<br /><br />At
				some point, the city of Königsberg (now <a class="link" href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/54.7065/20.5108" target="_blank">Kaliningrad, Russia</a>)
				had seven bridges in close proximity, as shown in <span class="highlighted">fig. 3.1</span>. Supposedly, the people of Königsberg used to entertain themselves
				by attempting to find a route around the city that used each bridge exactly once. None of them were successful because, as Euler would prove mathematically, the
				Seven Bridges of Königsberg is an impossible puzzle.

				If we consider each section of land to be a node, and each bridge to be an edge, then we get the graph in <span class="highlighted">fig. 3.2</span>. If the

				<span class="highlighted">fig. 3.2</span> is not an Eulerian graph. What Euler essentially said in his paper was that a connected graph is Eulerian if the

				<span class="highlighted">fig. 3.2</span>, every node is of odd degree, much to the people of Königsberg’s disappointment.<br /><br />Almost 150 years later,

				>. The article, written by J. J. Sylvester, looked at similarities between chemistry and algebra.<br /><br />Over 50 years after that, around 1931, the first
				textbook on graph theory, written by Dénes Kőnig, was published. Since then, many more books on graph theory have been written, providing mathematicians,
				chemists, electrical engineers, social scientists, and many more professions with ways of communicating their ideas.<br /><br />In 2004, the Academy of Discrete

			<h5 class="title" id="uses-search-engines">SEARCH ENGINES</h5>
			<p class="text">
				Search engines like Google create a directed graph of websites (the nodes) and hyperlinks (the edges). This helps them determine the pages that a series of
				links eventually lead to and which are the most popular, making for more relevant search results.

			<h5 class="title" id="uses-community-detection">SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING (COMMUNITY DETECTION)</h5>
			<p class="text">
				Graphs of social networks, where individual people are nodes and friends are edges, can be grouped (by an algorithm) into clusters of people who are more
				connected to each other than to people in another cluster. This helps advertisers since people in the same cluster are likely to have similar interests,
				characteristics, ideas, and desires.

			<h4 class="title" id="related-fields">5. RELATED FIELDS</h4>

			<div class="break"></div>

			<p class="text">
				As you saw above, there are so many fields, other than computer science, that can make use of graph theory. Pretty much any field that deals with things that
				are at all related or connected to other things could use graph theory—and probably already do.
			</p>

			<div class="break"></div>

			<h4 class="title" id="impact-on-society">6. IMPACT ON SOCIETY</h4>

			<div class="break"></div>

			<p class="text">
				Another takeaway from the above list of uses is that graph theory is all around us. Probably the most prominent example of graph theory in everyday life is
				Google Maps, an app that tells millions of people the best way to get to where they need/want to go. And the reduced travel times that come from knowing the
				best route means lower travel-related expenses, like gas.<br /><br />Pathfinding is also very useful to companies like Amazon, who have giant warehouses and
				robots that have to find things. Graph theory is therefore one of the reasons why Amazon is so successful and why they can ship things so fast.<br /><br />Some
				of the other examples, such as search engines and social media marketing have become very prevalent in the last couple of decades, due in no small part to
				graphs and their properties.

			<h4 class="title" id="ethics">7. ETHICS?</h4>

			<div class="break"></div>

			<p class="text">
				Graph theory is a mathematical concept, so using it is neither moral nor immoral. Where ethics come into play is what you do with it. The
				<b><a class="link" href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics" target="_blank">ACM</a></b> and
				<b><a class="link" href="https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8.html" target="_blank">IEEE</a></b> both have very detailed codes of ethics that
				you can refer to. Essentially, don’t use graph theory for anything illegal or anything that could cause harm or discriminate against certain people or groups.
				Make sure to have a positive impact on society, be honest and trustworthy, and respect people’s privacy.

			<h4 class="title" id="careers">8. CAREERS</h4>

			<div class="break"></div>

			<p class="text">
				As I’ve said before (see <a class="link same-page-link" href="#related-fields">5. RELATED FIELDS</a> and
				<a class="link same-page-link" href="#uses">4. USES</a>), graph theory is hard to avoid. All manner of fields outside computer science and mathematics use
				graphs and the like for all manner of purposes. However, to use graphs to their full potential, it would be useful for one to have a background in mathematics.
				This explainer barely scratches the surface of the massive iceberg that is graph theory, and the deeper down the rabbit hole you go, the more intense the math
				becomes.<br /><br />With all that said, software engineering still remains the most common example of a career that could make use of graph theory. Graph theory
				just lends itself really well to the problems programmers encounter. Becoming a software engineer generally requires a degree in software engineering or
				computer science. Once you’ve got one of those, if you don’t already know most of what there is to know about graph theory, you can learn a great deal from some
				very good books that can be found for free online.

			<h4 class="title" id="finite-craft">9. HOW I USED GRAPH THEORY — FINITE CRAFT</h4>

			<div class="break"></div>

			<p class="text">
				Inspired by <a class="link" href="https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/" target="_blank">Neal Agarwal’s Infinite Craft</a>, a game where you can combine the four
				elements into whatever you can imagine, I made <a class="link" href="craft.html">Finite Craft</a>. Each item can be considered a node in a graph, and each edge
				a combination, or recipe, that makes a new item. The code contains a large array of recipes and results, and although new items aren’t AI generated like they
				are in Infinite Craft, it’s still pretty fun. Thinking about the items in terms of graph theory let me make sure I added every combination of the first four
				items. The number of possible combinations between any number of items is a <b>triangular number</b>, and can be found with the formula in
				<span class="highlighted">fig. 9.3</span>.
